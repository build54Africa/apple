Small Courts Dispute Resolution System – Documentation
1. Problem Statement
Many disputes (money, property, services, contracts) end up in small claims court.

Current process is costly and slow because:

Parties often pay lawyers just for initial consultation.

Lack of clear guidance on steps before court.

People don’t know what evidence or documents are required.

Result: delays, high costs, frustration.

2. Proposed Solution
A Simplified Digital System to bridge the gap:
Guided Workflow: Step-by-step process from dispute → negotiation → mediation → demand letter → court filing.

AI-powered Assistance: Helps parties understand their rights and possible solutions without paying lawyer consultation fees upfront.

Document Preparation: Auto-generate checklists, mediation agreements, or demand letters.

Court Readiness: Prepare the right documents before filing in Small Claims Court.

3. Key Workflow (Simplified)
Dispute Arises → Capture issue, value involved, evidence.

Direct Negotiation → Suggest compromises.

Mediation (ADR) → Facilitate neutral discussion.

AI Guidance (instead of lawyer) → Explain rights, risks, required documents.

Demand Letter → Auto-generate and send to other party.

Court Preparation → System ensures evidence and forms are ready.

4. Benefits
Cheaper: Reduce reliance on lawyer consultation fees.

Faster: Clear steps reduce delays.

Accessible: Even non-lawyers can follow the process.

Confidence: Users enter court prepared with documents.

5. Example Use Case
Two parties dispute over unpaid rent (KES 150,000).

System guides:

Collect lease contract & payment receipts.

Attempt negotiation → mediation.

If unresolved, auto-generate a demand letter.

Finally, prepare court forms for Small Claims Court.

In summary: This system bridges the gap between informal dispute resolution and small claims court, cutting costs, time, and complexity for ordinary citizens.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
