Small Courts Dispute Resolution System – Documentation
1. Problem Statement
Many disputes (money, property, services, contracts) end up in small claims court.

Current process is costly and slow because:

Parties often pay lawyers just for initial consultation.

Lack of clear guidance on steps before court.

People don’t know what evidence or documents are required.

Result: delays, high costs, frustration.

2. Proposed Solution
A Simplified Digital System to bridge the gap:
Guided Workflow: Step-by-step process from dispute → negotiation → mediation → demand letter → court filing.

AI-powered Assistance: Helps parties understand their rights and possible solutions without paying lawyer consultation fees upfront.

Document Preparation: Auto-generate checklists, mediation agreements, or demand letters.

Court Readiness: Prepare the right documents before filing in Small Claims Court.

3. Key Workflow (Simplified)
Dispute Arises → Capture issue, value involved, evidence.

Direct Negotiation → Suggest compromises.

Mediation (ADR) → Facilitate neutral discussion.

AI Guidance (instead of lawyer) → Explain rights, risks, required documents.

Demand Letter → Auto-generate and send to other party.

Court Preparation → System ensures evidence and forms are ready.

4. Benefits
Cheaper: Reduce reliance on lawyer consultation fees.

Faster: Clear steps reduce delays.

Accessible: Even non-lawyers can follow the process.

Confidence: Users enter court prepared with documents.

5. Example Use Case
Two parties dispute over unpaid rent (KES 150,000).

System guides:

Collect lease contract & payment receipts.

Attempt negotiation → mediation.

If unresolved, auto-generate a demand letter.

Finally, prepare court forms for Small Claims Court.

In summary: This system bridges the gap between informal dispute resolution and small claims court, cutting costs, time, and complexity for ordinary citizens.
